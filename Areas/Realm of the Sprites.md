### Sprites
Sprites are diminutive, mischievous, and curious creatures, living in parallel pocket dimensions that mirror the places they were originally settled.
They love exploring new things, and are quick to embrace new ideas and ways of thinking.

When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite, as they are the most numerous among them.

Sprites were in ages past hunted for sport, for the dust from their wings or poached as pets.
When more and more were born without wings, due to the ones having them being hunted, the sprites knew they had to take action and decided to seal off their towns from the world beyond.
They weaved magic of nature and arcane to create a mirror of the world where the spell was cast, a small parallel bubble where they could thrive in peace.
Vast for creatures their size, but perhaps a rather confined space for any larger.

However, from time to time, creatures from the outside would cross the barrier into the sprites' pocket dimensions, by sheer chance or intentionally.
When this happened, the sprites would refer to it as a kaiju invasion, meaning a beast from the outside.
To defend their cities from these invasions, they would develop more and more sophisticated technologies, and often making use of their arcane magic through it.
Some of these technologies being gigantic (at least by sprite standards) robots they pilot, referred to as mechs, or mecha, to compensate for the fact that most adversaries they face severely dwarf them by comparison.

Practitioners of more spiritual magics, divine or primal, often live in shrines or on the fringes of sprite pocket dimensions (sometimes even on the other side of the barrier), having been slightly alienated by the material and technological focus of the rest of their society.

The majority of sprite communities are situated on Ilvern, their place of origin.
As most races from Ilvern, sprites have a deep affinity for nature, leading them to seamlessly weave it into their now metropolitan cities, through expansive parks and tree-lined avenues. Nevertheless, sprite settlements can be found anywhere other races reside.

Sprites born with wings these days are viewed with awe and are expected to achieve great things.
Some sprites embrace this and flourish under the adoration, becoming great leaders or heroes, while others buckle under the pressure and end up leaving the safety of their cities and or worse.
Some sprites also have wings grow in later, a cause for celebration and excitement for most for whom it happens.
